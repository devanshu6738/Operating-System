ðŸ“– About This Project
This project is a collection of C programs that implement core Operating System concepts. The primary goal is to provide simple, well-documented code to help understand the inner workings of an OS. Each program focuses on a specific algorithm or problem, from process scheduling to memory management.

âœ¨ Topics Covered
This repository includes implementations for the following OS topics:

CPU Scheduling Algorithms:

First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)

Shortest Job First (SJF) - Preemptive and Non-Preemptive

Priority Scheduling - Preemptive and Non-Preemptive

Round Robin Scheduling

Process Synchronization:

The Producer-Consumer Problem

The Reader-Writer Problem

The Dining Philosophers Problem

Deadlock Avoidance:

Banker's Algorithm

Memory Management:

Memory allocation schemes like First Fit, Best Fit, and Worst Fit.

Page Replacement Algorithms:

First-In, First-Out (FIFO)

Least Recently Used (LRU)

Optimal Page Replacement
